Product 32 was the top 10th sold product with the sale of 32.5K. \n\n\n2. Product sale by Quantity\nA trend of products sold in a pair of 2 were seen to make highest contribution to sales. The top 100 sold products were found with highest sales were sold in a **pair of 2** according to the trend visualized. \n\n3. Sales by customer segment\nThe top sold product Dorito corn chip was bought mostly by OLDER SINGLES/ COUPLES. In addition, OLDER SINGLES/ COUPLES have contributed significanty to oveall sales of different products in the markets. \n\n4.
